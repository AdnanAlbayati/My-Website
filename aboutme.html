        <p>I am a Salford University engineering graduate. My background is in gas and petroleum engineering. Throughout my studies, I was very interested in IT and technology. During my studies, I began to teach myself by watching videos and reading online about information on assembling and disassembling electronic devices. From 2010 to 2012, I began to prepare myself to enter this domain. During these two years, I spent the majority of my time learning about technology and information technology. Soon after, I started my own business, selling new, refurbished, and used laptops and PCs. I persisted until I became a well-known technology investor. If anyone is interested, I still sell perfect condition laptops and PCs with warranties. When the warranty expires, I continue to provide assistance and support, which my customers appreciate. I am also able to deliver online courses where I teach how to deal with electronic devices (laptops and PCs).  </p>

        <p>My favorite hobby is reading. I enjoy reading a book when I am free. I started to do it when I was four years old. The first time I did it, I felt interested. So, I kept reading. The teachers always taught me to read the difficult words. I was happy when I read a story with a happy ending. I was thrilled when I read a detective story. I enjoy reading because I like to explore the imaginative world of my favorite author, J.K.Rowling who writes “ Harry Potter” . There are a lot of advantages of reading. Reading can make me relaxed and calm. I can also learn new vocabulary items. Then I can further improve my English. Moreover, it can give me an unlimited imagination, so I can write books in the future. I can learn the different cultures and customs of other countries in the world too.  I read at least one hour every day. I read books by myself. I usually read it at home. I wish I could read different kinds of books because it might be very challenging. As I love reading, this helped more to discover more about to deal with electronic devices. </p>

         <p> In terms of sports, my main hobby is mountain biking and I have been riding regularly for 4 years. During this time I have had to carry out a lot of maintenance on my bike which has led to my interest in how they work and all the aspects of bike development. For example carbon fiber is replacing aluminum as the material of choice for most components due to its ability to improve strength while reducing weight. This interest has led me to taking a course on advanced mountain bike maintenance. Loving this type enabled me to be a risk taker and helped me to challage the difficulties that I face in my business. </p>
